# Introduction II

This week, I want you to explore with you the basics of Jupyter Notebooks. In the first place, you won't have to program anything by yourself at this point. I just want you to familiarize yourself with the application so that next time, we can dive right into our first Python programming session! All I want you to do for today, is (a) to open a jupyter notebook on your computer, (b) follow me while I go through a first notebook covering some functionality of jupyter notebooks, and complete the first (very easy!) homework assignmentt. 

The things covered in this section will introduce central concepts for our subsequent endeavors in this class. More precisely, we'll explore `jupyter notebooks` as one form of interacting with your computer, specifically `python`. Getting a good hang of this will be important as most of our `python` endeavors will happen within `jupyter notebooks` and they are a staple in research workflows.

If you run into any issues, we will discuss them next week! Have fun!


### Objectives üìç

- Learn how to open jupyter notebooks locally and create your own jupyter notebook
- learn basic and efficient usage of the jupyter ecosystem & notebooks


### Materials üìì

Please see the rendered version of the `jupyter notebook` [Introduction II - jupyter notebooks](https://cfiebach.github.io/Python_For_Psychologists_25-26/introduction/intro_jupyter.html) in the `ToC` on the left.



### tasks for subsequent meeting üñ•Ô∏è‚úçüèΩüìñ

You should create a `jupyter notebook` with
- **mandatory**:  `3 different cells`:
            - 1 rendered markdown cell within which you name your favorite movie and describe why you like it via  
              max. 2 sentences
            - 1 code cell with an equation (e.g. `1+1`, `(a+b)/(c+d)`, etc.)
            - 1 raw cell with your favorite snack
- **optional**: try to include a picture of your favorite animal
- save the notebook and e-mail it to fiebach@psych.uni-frankfurt.de

Please note that the deadline for the assignment is: Tuesday Nov 04 2025, 11:59 PM EST.
