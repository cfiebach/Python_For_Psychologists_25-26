# General outline
Within this course, we will talk about and work through the core aspects of using `python` for a scientific project, i.e. `data acquisition` and `data analyzes`. 
In order to provide a solid basis for the practical work on these topics, they will be preceded by an in-depth `introduction` that will introduce and outline central characteristics and functions of the `python` programming language.
These three defining parts will also be used as cornerstones of the course outline and will entail respective more-detailed subsections.

## Schedule

Please see below for our current optimistic schedule. Depending on our progress, potential problems and different forms of learning, content and times might change a bit. Each lecture will be divided into two parts: a lecture part and a practicle part where you work on problems in groups.


```{note}
The optimistic schedule below may be subject of change, dependent on time constraints and progress made in the previous meetings. The sessions for the following week or two will be updated here the week before.
