# Introduction II

This week, I want you to explore with you the basics of Jupyter Notebooks. In the first place, you won't have to program anything by yourself at this point. I just want you to familiarize yourself with the application so that next time, we can dive right into our first Python programming session! All I want you to do for today, is (a) to open a jupyter notebook on your computer, (b) follow me while I go through a first notebook covering some functionality of jupyter notebooks, and complete the first (very easy!) homework assignmentt. 

The things covered in this section will introduce central concepts for our subsequent endeavors in this class. More precisely, we'll explore `jupyter notebooks` as one form of interacting with your computer, specifically `python`. Getting a good hang of this will be important as most of our `python` endeavors will happen within `jupyter notebooks` and they are a staple in research workflows.

If you run into any issues, we will discuss them next week! Have fun!


### Objectives üìç

- Learn how to open jupyter notebooks locally and create your own jupyter notebook
- learn basic and efficient usage of the jupyter ecosystem & notebooks


### Materials üìì

Please see the rendered version of the `jupyter notebook` [Introduction II - jupyter notebooks](https://cfiebach.github.io/Python_For_Psychologists_25-26/introduction/intro_jupyter.html) in the `ToC` on the left.



### tasks for subsequent meeting üñ•Ô∏è‚úçüèΩüìñ

You should create a `jupyter notebook` with
- **mandatory**:  `3 different cells`:
            - 1 rendered markdown cell within which you name your favorite movie and describe why you like it via  
              max. 2 sentences
            - 1 code cell with an equation (e.g. `1+1`, `(a+b)/(c+d)`, etc.)
            - 1 raw cell with your favorite snack
- **optional**: try to include a picture of your favorite animal
- save the notebook and e-mail it to fiebach@psych.uni-frankfurt.de

Please note that the deadline for the assignment is: Tuesday Nov 04 2025, 11:59 PM EST.


## Open jupyter notebook

There are different ways to open the program. If you installed Anaconda, you can open the `Anaconda Navigator` and from your `base` envirnoment, jupyter notebooks should have already been installed. Just click on `Launch` and youre ready to go!

If you installed miniconda, you won't have the `Navigagor`. Instead, what you should do, is open your `Terminal` and type in `jupyter notebook`. Make sure your `base` environment is activated. If you can't see the `(base)` that you see in the picture, type in `conda init` or `conda activate base`.

If you start `jupyter notebook` from the terminal, a lot of text will appear in your terminal which has something to do with the server that the notebook is hosted on locally. It should also automatically open a `homepage` on your browser, if it doesn't, copy paste the link from your terminal and open it in your browser.

Your jupyter homepage should look something like this:

## Create your own notebook

The last thing I want you to do, is open your own notebook and save it. Click on `New` and select `python 3 (ipykernel)`. It will create a new empty notebook for you with a python 3 kernel.

Tada! now you can save this notebook under `File` `save as`. We will go from here next time. If you're eager to explore more, feel free to do so, for example [over here](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebook.html).
